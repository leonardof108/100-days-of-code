### Day 1: February 27, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Studied fundamental data structures with Scott Barret's amazing course on Udemy, also progressed a lot in the Head First Java textbook.

**Thoughts:** Understanding how these structures work under the hood makes problem-solving easier.\
Javaâ€™s memory management and OOP principles help in designing efficient data structures.

### Day 2: February 28, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Studied more data structures, built a little task manager.

**Thoughts:** Head First Java 2nd edition is pretty outdated, the (fairly) recent 3rd edition covers Java 8 which brings pretty drastic things the language (lambdas, for one) compared to the one they use in the 2nd edition (Java 5), so I switched to the 3rd edition.
